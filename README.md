# ocv2_algo
This repo contains examples and scripts so you can add the ocv2 algorithm to your projects

Firstly build libocv2.dll / libocv2.so via auto script (tested on ubuntu 16 - 21 / if target is windows, requires ubuntu 21)


```

git clone https://github.com/ocvcoin/ocv2_algo.git

cd ocv2_algo && sudo bash build.sh

```


When the script is finished, it will give you the compiler flags so you can add it to the project you want.
